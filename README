ClientArea 0.1 Alpha

Clients will be able to login. They will have groups and each group has a 
corresponding directory in the "storage".

Each directory will have corresponding README file. ClientArea will read
the README file and display the information in the browser.

If you are familiar with the README file in Github, then it like it but we can 
have more for every sub-directory.

For files: if we have a file named "myawesomefile.txt" your corresponding README
file for it will be "myawesomefile.txt.README". Since this is a little tedious,
I will probably implement one single "READMEFILES" containing all the
description and filename in the current directory. I am looking at using a YAML
file for this.
