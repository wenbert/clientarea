ClientArea 0.1 Alpha

Clients will be able to login. They will have groups and each group has a 
corresponding directory in the "storage".

Each directory will have corresponding README file. ClientArea will read
the README file and display the information in the browser.

If you are familiar with the README file in Github, then it is like it but we 
can have more for every sub-directory.
